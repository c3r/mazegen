# Mazegen
Simple algorithm for maze generation with visualization.

## Reguirements
- SDL2

## Example maze
The following example is animated by simply inserting some delay into the maze generation algorithm and drawing the whole thing with every step.

## Archipelago generation
Apparently, when enough fiddled with, this kind of maze generation algorithm can be also used to generate a 2D graphics representation of islands archipelago. Apparently, the intermediate product, yielded after some fraction of work being done on the maze generation looks like a complicated island archipelago.

The following picutre was generated by simply stopping the mazegen algorithm after visiting 65% of all maze cells.
